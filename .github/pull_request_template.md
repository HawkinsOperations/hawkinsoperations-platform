## Truth Surface

Classify the truth surface affected by this PR:

- [ ] Repo/source truth
- [ ] Validation truth
- [ ] Runtime contract or runtime-state reference
- [ ] Signal/evidence reference
- [ ] Public proof or public wording
- [ ] Reviewer routing / governance documentation
- [ ] Other:

## Claim Boundary

State what this PR can safely claim and what it does not prove.

## Testing / Validation

List checks run, checks not run, and any required status checks.

Green CI/status checks are not merge authority.

## Security / Privacy

State whether private-term, public-safety, secret, hostname, LAN IP, raw-log, screenshot, CSV export, or local evidence-path risk was reviewed.

## Human Review Authority

Codex review is AI labor, not human governance.

Visible human GitHub review activity is required before merge when this PR affects governance, proof, validation, detection logic, CI enforcement, website/public wording, inventory, or claim-bearing artifacts.

Solo authority is acceptable when disclosed. Fake independence is not.

Do not use a second GitHub account controlled by Raylee for fake independent approval.

Before merge recommendation, prepare a merge-readiness packet with repo, PR number/link, branch, changed files, merge state, check/status summary, review/comment status, unresolved Codex feedback, unresolved conversations, private-term risk, claim-boundary impact, proof-boundary impact, public surface impact, whether visible human governance review exists, paste-ready Raylee review comment, and final state: MERGE_READY, NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW, NEEDS_CHANGES, or BLOCKED.

MERGE_APPROVED is required before merge, auto-merge, or final merge recommendation.

## HawkinsOperations Guardrails

Website/GitHub rendering is not proof.

This PR must not promote runtime-active, signal-observed, evidence-linked public proof, public-safe, production-ready, fleet-wide, Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, or AI-approved status unless separately supported by scoped evidence and Raylee approval.
